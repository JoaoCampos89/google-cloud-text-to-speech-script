Now you will see at the left several blocks to add on your Marketplace but we can't start just like that because it will be an ugly marketplace. let's be honest. let's make in the way it should be. let's start with the background. we have a nice background</speak>

		</media>
		<media begin="73.700s">

		</media>
		<media begin="86.400s">
			<speak> we wouldn't use this as a moment. We will use a gradient color because are amazing and fits perfectly for our needs</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="97.500s">
			<speak> I'm thinking to build on the homepage</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="101.900s">
			<speak> a custom section full of auto-generated art so I think this will fit amazing. Let me change here some colors because I think this color with suit better than this we have now. Save it. let's keep it simple</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="129.500s">

		</media>
		<media begin="145.300s">
			<speak> let's add a text block because we will need to welcome our people to the marketplace. We need to make the people feel comfy to make them buy our NFTs.</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="164.500s">

		</media>
		<media begin="260.500s">
			<speak> black line that must be aligned with the NFT you're adding because if you miss it will be added somewhere and you will need to reorganize again</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="271.200s">
			<speak> so we have the NFTs here and lets add another one because we have some NFTs to share. Okay we have four NFTs but I think we don't have enough padding to make those NFTS looks centered. Let's add a container click again on the close button let's select the container</speak>
		</media>
		<media begin="293.200s">
			<speak> and let's place it here and now let's migrate our NFTs inside the container to make them look well Centered as you can see I'm doing the same that I did before but now I'm adding the nFTs inside the container and the container is inside the background</speak>
