Hello DexKit Community

Today I am gonna show you how to create your first nft marketplace. All this in few seconds. 

Before start you need to have a Metamask wallet already installed, if you don't know how to do it, we have here a nice tutorial for it.

Ok, now I am assuming you have an installed Metamask wallet. So let's go!


Open this link below: whitelabel-nft.dexkit.com/admin/setup
<break time="1000ms"/>

Now fill the name you want for your marketplace. Let's start here with my awesome marketplace.
<break time="7000ms"/>
Now we fill an email, this email is used to receive notifications from DexKit team.

After filling these two fields, you just type on button create marketplace.

It will ask you now to login to DexKit app, note that this login it will last 24 hours.
<break time="1000ms"/>
Sign and <break time="1000ms"/> <emphasis level="strong">voila you have you new awesome marketplace!</emphasis> You will have an assigned domain here, wait a bit to propagate before open it, typically 5 to 10 minutes.

And that's it. Thanks for Watching!
